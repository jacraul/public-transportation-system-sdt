## Project Description
Our system proposal is a modern integrated solution designed to unify the public transportation experience across Bucharest metropolitan area. Nowadays, there are several applications (STB - InfoTB, BiletTB; Metrorex- website for consulting the timetable and another one for recharging the transportation card; CFR website and app) to plan a single journey. Our project aims to solve this by creating a single, user-friendly platform that provides multimodal route planning and real-time tracking. 

### Core Features
- #### Integrated Multimodal Route Planning:
  The system will calculate the optimal route from point A to point B by combining available transportation options (bus, tram, trolleybus, underground metro, regional CFR trains), of course the user can choose from the available options its wishes
- #### Real Time Vehicle Tracking
  The system will be able to monitor every single transportation option via GPS on STS (ro Serviciul de Telecomunicatii Speciale / en Specials Telecommunication Service) map (maps.stscloud.ro). For this project we will simulate the tracking via the timeschedule available on STB website, CFR dataset and data.gov, alongside with simulation for delays.
- ### Personalization and User accounts
  The registered user can save frequent locations such as work, home and so on, but can also add locations with labels and colours to identify them easily.
